## System requirements

Currently, only Windows is supported, but the plugin should work on all platforms OneWare Studio runs on, except
browsers.

## Dependencies

Your installation of OneWare Studio needs to have the `OSS Cad Suite Integration` installed with version 2025-01-22 or
later, as well as the most recent version of the `GHDL Extension`.

# About

This repository contains the source code for two plugins for [OneWare Studio](https://github.com/one-ware/OneWare). They
are developed by
TH KÃ¶ln (University of Applied Sciences Cologne) as part of
the [FEntwumS research project](https://www.th-koeln.de/informations-medien-und-elektrotechnik/forschungsprojekt-fentwums_121126.php).

## Installation

Since this plugin is currently in a testing phase, it is not yet available by default from the OneWare Studio Package
Manager. To install this plugin, you will need to add a custom package source. Please follow these steps:

1. Open the settings menu
2. Go to the `Package Manager` tab
3. Add a new custom package source pointing to
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FEntwumS/FEntwumS.NetlistViewer/refs/heads/master/oneware-extension.json`
4. Click `Save`, then exit the settings menu
5. Open the package manager
6. Refresh the package manager
7. Done! The plugin should now be available for you to install!
8. Install both the `FEntwumS.NetlistViewer Extension` plugin as well as the `FEntwumS NetlistViewer Backend`  and the
   `Eclipse Adoptiom OpenJDK` binaries using the package manager

## Netlist viewer

The FEntwumS Netlist Viewer plugin allows users to automatically generate and interactively view netlists for their HDL
designs inside OneWare Studio. It is a frontend building on
the [FEntwumS Netlist Reader Backend](https://github.com/FEntwumS/NetlistReaderBackend). You can run the backend, which
does all the layouting, either on your local machine or on a remote server in your local network. The default (and
recommended) configuration is to run the backend locally. If this is all you need, you just need to install the plugin.
It will install and start the backend automatically. You may be prompted to allow network access for the OpenJDK binary
by your operating system. Please grant this access, otherwise the netlist viewer will not work.

### Using a remote backend

If you plan on using a local backend install (the default and recommended case), you can skip this section.

If you want to use a remote backend, you will need to deploy it yourself. Instructions on how to do so can be
found [here](https://github.com/FEntwumS/NetlistReaderBackend?tab=readme-ov-file#can-i-use-the-backend-separately-from-the-frontend).
Since the traffic between the backend and the viewer is **neither encrypted nor authenticated**, you should only use a
remote
backend **within local and trusted networks**.

When you have your backend up and running, you will need to enter the backends IP address and port
(the default port is 8080) in the settings. You also need to uncheck the box for "Use local backend server".

### Viewing your design

Now that you have installed the plugin, you can start viewing and interacting with your HDL designs. By simply
right-clicking your top level entity and choosing the "View netlist for [insert your entity here]", the plugin will
automatically generate a netlist using yosys and then display it in a new tab. You can zoom using your mouse wheel,
clicking and dragging with the left mouse button pans the view and left-clicking on an entity will either expand or
collapse it (depending on whether the entity is collapsed or not).

Left-clicking on a cell will open the corresponding HDL file. Synthesized Verilog code is opened for VHDL designs at the
moment. Future work will enable the direct opening of the corresponding VHDL file.

### Viewing a generated netlist

&#x26A0;**IMPORTANT**&#x26A0;: The backend only supports netlists generated by Yosys 0.49 and newer, as it uses the
flatten separator, which needs to be set using `scratchpad -set flatten.separator \";\"`.

There are certain requirements that a netlist needs to fulfill to be viewable by the netlist viewer. At a minimum, it
needs to be flattened (preferably using the `-scopename` option), the toplevel entity needs to be specified using the
`hierarchy` command and all blackbox cells such as device specific primitives need to have port direction information.
The netlist file needs to be of the `.json` filetype. To ensure that device specific primitives contain information on
port directions, load the appropriate libraries. For example, to add this information for the device primitives of the
Cologne Chip Gatemate series of FPGAs you need to run
`read_verilog -lib -specify +/gatemate/cells_sim.v +/gatemate/cells_bb.v`. The appropriate command can be found on the
[synthesis page](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/synth_gatemate.html) for the FPGA you are
using.

The recommended command to generate a netlist is
`scratchpad -set flatten.separator \";\"; hierarchy -check -top <top>; proc; memory -nomap; flatten -scopename; write_json -compat-int <top>.json`.
This sequence
expects the HDL files to be fully loaded (e.g. using the `read_verilog` command).

While the viewing of post-synthesis netlists is currently not well-supported, you should be able to view most
post-synthesis netlists.

Since OneWare Studio does not show json files in the Project Explorer, you will need to add the `.json` filetype
manually. To do this, please right click on the project containing the netlist, choose the `Edit` option and add an
entry `*.json` to the list `Files to Include`.

# Troubleshooting

## I cannot find a suitable OSS Cad Suite Integration plugin version

Please make sure your version of OneWare Studio has all updates installed. An appropriate version of the OSS Cad Suite
Integration plugin is available in OneWare Studio 0.21.1.0 and later.

## I started OneWare Studio and the tab that should show my netlist is empty

Currently, it is not possible to store the netlist when OneWare Studio is closed. Please close the tab and regenerate
the netlist.

## `ERROR: GHDL standard is not set`

Please edit your project settings to include the used VHDL-Standard.

## `ERROR: Module ... is not part of the design`

Please make sure that you have specified the correct device manufacturer and device family in the settings.
The available options are listed on the synth_<...> pages in
the [Yosys documentation](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd_ref.html).

## `ERROR: Module <...> not found!`

If you have recently updated any plugins, e.g. the OSS Cad Suite integration plugin, please restart OneWare Studio. If
this issue persists after a restart, please file a bug report.

## I generated a netlist using the OneWare Studio command, but I can't see all my entity instances

The builtin Json Netlist generation does not output a flattened netlist. If you want to be able to expand your entities,
you need to right-click your toplevel entity and use the "View netlist for [...]" option.

## I generated a netlist myself, but I can't seem to find it in the project explorer

By default, OneWare Studio does not display `.json` files in the project explorer. To fix this, you will need to add the
`.json` filetype manually. To do this, please right click on the project containing the netlist, choose the `Edit`
option and add an entry `*.json` to the list `Files to Include`.

## `An internal server error occured. Please file a bug report if this problem persists.`

First, please make sure that you have selected the correct device manufacturer and device family in the settings. If the
design you are trying to view is written in VHDL, make sure that you have set the correct VHDL standard level in the
settings (the default is 93c). You can find a detailed explanation of the VHDL standard levels in
the [GHDL documentation](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/using/ImplementationOfVHDL.html#vhdl-standards).

Please file a bug report including the netlist that you wanted to view. If you used our plugin to generate the netlist,
you can find the file under `build/netlist/<top>.json` in your project directory.

## `The server could not be reached` or `The address ... could not be resolved`

If you are using a remote backend installation, please make sure that you have entered the correct backend address and
port and that the provided address is reachable.

If you are using a local backend installation, please file a bug report.
